== Creating Service Instances for Hello World Spring Cloud Services Demo Application
> Each of these services takes a few minutes to initialize while creating application instances and other resources to support them. With many students performing the same actions on PCF3 at the same time, please be patient while initialization completes.

. Create the services the demo application depends on, first start with an instance of the config service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-config-server standard config-server
Creating service instance config-server in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
----

. Now, we need an instance of the service registry service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-service-registry standard service-registry
Creating service instance service-registry in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
----

. The final service that we need is for the circuit breaker dashboard.
+
----
$cf create-service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker
Creating service instance circuit-breaker in org student20-org / space development as student20...
OK
----
+
. First we need to configure the config server. Open the Application Manager console and scroll down until you see the Spring Cloud services.  Under the "config-server", click "Manage".
+

+
. You should see a blank page for the Config Server.
+

+
. Later you will set up your own configuration repository in Github.  For now, enter "https://github.com/bboe-pivotal/hello-world-config-repo". Click Submit when ready.

== Build and Push the applications

. Change to the directory that contains hello-ui and hello-server components.
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_05/lab_08/hello-world
----

. Open the manifest.yml file.  Notice the application names and the service bindings.

.  Spring Cloud Services uses HTTPS for all client-to-service communication. If your Pivotal Cloud Foundry installation is using a self-signed SSL certificate, the certificate will need to be added to the JVM truststore before your client application can use a Service Registry service instance to discover a service application. Start by taking note of the Cloud Foundry API endpoint of your environment.
+
----
$cf api
API endpoint: https://api.run.pivotal.io (API version: 2.43.0)
----

. Enable Spring Cloud Services to add the certificate automatically by setting the CF_TARGET environment variable on the hello-server and hello-ui applications to the API endpoint of your Elastic Runtime instance. First do this for the hello-server application.
+
----
$cf set-env hello-server CF_TARGET https://api.run.pivotal.io
Setting env variable 'CF_TARGET' to 'https://api.run.pivotal.io' for app hello-server in org instructor-org / space development as instructor...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. Then repeat for the hello-ui application
+
----
$cf set-env hello-ui CF_TARGET https://api.run.pivotal.io
Setting env variable 'CF_TARGET' to 'https://api.run.pivotal.io' for app hello-ui in org instructor-org / space development as instructor...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. Now the applications are ready to run. First start the hello-server application.
